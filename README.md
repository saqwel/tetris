# tetris
Tetris - one of the most popular game in the world.

This is pretty simple browser implementation of tetris. It uses google svg library.  I wrote it for fun when I had a lot of free time at work and wanted to practice in web animations.

## How to use
1. Download files to a folder on your local disk:
  - index.html;
  - svg.js.
2. Run index.html.
